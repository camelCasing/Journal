**Round Up**

i have known about this for a while but not really told anyone, if you buy something in a game, they get 40% right? and so this should work.

**Method**

say you spent 100 robux on a item in a group,
they get 70% which is 70 robux and if you use it in a funds game on a other group they would get 40% or 40 robux.
if you wait for that to process you can give yourself 110% of the robux back that you spent

**Outcome**

group gets 70
alt-group gets 40
